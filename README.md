  <h1>Recruiting Process</h1>
  <p>During my junior year I began to get recruited. The first school that called me was Kent State. They contacted me after I did really well at a very competitive high school tournament in North Carolina called Super 32. After the first call came many others did as well. School after school was reaching out to see if I wanted to wrestle for their university. At first, this was all a little overwhelming, but in time I got used to it and I learned to not get emotional, but just take every call 1 by 1. After Winning state my junior year.I began to take a visits.The first visit I took was to the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, IA. This was a very cool opportunity and although I loved everything about the wrestling program, it just did not seem like the school for me. That's the thing people might not realize about recruiting. You're not just going to a school for the sport you're interested in, you're also going somewhere that you want to be happy with for the next five years of your life and that was something that I seriously had to take into consideration. I couldn't just be happy with the wrestling program, I had to be happy with where I was going to be living as well.The next visit I took was to the University of Iowa. I loved everything about this place and it did feel like home to me. But after an amazing visit, the coaches did not reach back out to me and this stung a little bit. After that, I was contacted by the University of Wisconsin. Being a badger fan all my life.And being from the Milwaukee area, this was a potential dream come true. I have been following Badger Sports my whole life and to know that it was possible to wear that W on my chest and represent the state that I have been wrestling for my whole life up until this point was very attractive to me.Talking it over with my parents, friends and coaches I had decided that the University of Wisconsin was the best place for me. In terms of the scholarship money I was being offered, the school itself and the wrestling program, combined with the fact that they were getting a new coaching staff, that I also liked a lot, I felt that it was the best option for me. I am embarking on my senior season at Wisconsin and I can't wait to get started.</p>
